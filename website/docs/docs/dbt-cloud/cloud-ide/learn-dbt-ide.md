**Learn the dbt Cloud IDE**  

The dbt Cloud IDE includes robust features to:

- Write modular SQL models with SELECT statements and the `ref()` function– dbt handles the chore of dependency management,
- Test every model prior to production, and share dynamically generated documentation with all data stakeholders,
- Deploy safely using dev environments. Git-enabled version control enables collaboration and a return to previous states.

**File and Replace** 

You can quickly find text and replace it in the file you have opened. Press ⌘F to open the Find and Replace widget in the IDE, and the search results will be highlighted in the editor and code outline. If there is more than one matched result in the current opened file, you can press up and down arrows to head to next or previous result in the widget.

**Search across files** 

You can quickly search over all files in the IDE on your current project. To search, press ⌘O and write your file name. The results will quickly appear in the results box under the search text and are grouped into files containing the search term.  You can click on one of the results to view it in the IDE.

**Keyboard shortcuts** 

The IDE has a robust selection of default keyboard shortcuts to make development more productive and easier for everyone. Press `fn + F1` on your keyboard to bring up a menu of the IDE shortcuts.

**File Explorer** 

The IDE has a File Explorer, which allows you to organize your project and manage your files/folders. You can create, edit or delete files/folders by clicking the 3 dots in the File explorer section. You can also drag and drop files with ease and use the file breadcrumb for quick, linear navigation.
